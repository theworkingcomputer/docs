I drink a lot

of coffee, and I think it's affecting my carbohydrate metabolism. We all know about caffeine, right? Let's see how much I remember, of the top of my head.

Somehow, this bizarre-looking, partly cyclic xanthine thing gets into your system. Injected by a hostile cherry pit. Maybe.

Anyway, it crosses over, again, somehow moving from the relatively profane tube-within-a-tube of your gut (outside of the actual chemical factory of your metabolic pathways) into the apse of your metabolic cathedral, the hepatic artery, in ten to fifteen minutes, mere milliseconds away from the cloistered sanctuary of cellular processes and certainly, at most, a few seconds and a blood/brain barrier away from the Holy of Holies, your neurons.

It seems to do the same thing wherever it goes. Caffeine is a cyclic-AMP inhibitor. It increases the rate of glucose metabolism and changes the activity of certain kinds of smooth muscle (yep, much like a certain little blue pill beloved of men of a particular age, with societally acceptable treatable "performance issues". ... 'Cept the blue pill is a cyclic-GMP inhibitor. Same-same.), raising and/or lowering blood pressure in locations throughout the various, um, pews, corridors, etc., of our over-extended metaphor. More energy for stuff, better hydraulics, heightened awareness, better focus.

Anyway, I have become a [good] coffee whore. I will do anything for a good cup of coffee. I don't mean for you, or anyone else. More on htat, later.

Example:

Not long ago, on a trip to Vermont, my partner, Marcy, and I found a pleasant little farm-to-table diner out in the sticks. It was kind of home-y, lots of locals there, hard to get a table; all the signs of a great place.

Turns out, they hire a "chef" from a prominent New England cooking school to handle the actual heavy lifting of converting the farm-stuffs into edible fare for the patrons during the busy season. Good enough. ...

Things were a bit off. Gritty lettuce in the Caesar salad. Odd, overly mustard-y dressing, very light on anchovies. Dry, tough roast beef on the French dip. Generic, bland sweet potato fries. Probably not, generally, worth a return visit, even if we are in the area.

Except that, they source their coffee from a local roaster, and it was awesome. Awesome, awe-inspiring, truly magnificent coffee. We haven't stopped talking about it since, and may well plan our next venture to include a trip to that part of Vermont, just to go to that restaurant.

Coffee whore.

My life revolves around the stuff.
