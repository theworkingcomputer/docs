I drink a lot
*************
of coffee, and I think it's affecting my carbohydrate metabolism. We all know about caffeine, right? Let's see how much I remember, of the top of my head.

Somehow, this bizarre-looking, partly cyclic xanthine thing gets into your system. Injected by a hostile cherry pit. Maybe.

So it crosses over, again, *somehow* moving from the relatively profane tube-within-a-tube of your gut (outside of the actual chemical factory of your metabolic pathways) into the apse of your metabolic cathedral, the hepatic artery, in ten to fifteen minutes, mere milliseconds away from the cloistered sanctuary of cellular processes and certainly, at most, a few seconds and a blood/brain barrier away from the Holy of Holies, your neurons.

It seems to do the same thing wherever it goes. Caffeine is a cyclic-AMP (adenosine monophosphate) inhibitor. It increases the rate of glucose metabolism and changes the activity of certain kinds of smooth muscle (yep, much like that little blue pill beloved of men of a certain age and proclivity, with (societally acceptable) treatable "performance issues". ... 'Cept the blue pill is a cyclic-*GMP* (guanosine) inhibitor. Same-same.), raising and/or lowering blood pressure in locations throughout the various, um, pews, corridors, and apses of our over-extended metaphor. More energy for stuff, better hydraulics, heightened awareness, better focus.

Increasing the rate
*******************
of glucose metabolism (perhaps -- this is the conjectural part) effects a change in the amount of the stuff in one's bloodstream by removing it and converting it into "energy molecules" like ATP, so the liver, pancreas, et al, act to bump up the amount of glucose available by increasing the amount coming in to match what's going out. This is fine, and expected, but for three things:

       1) When the caffeine buzz starts to wear off (not had any coffee in a while -- problems here, losing focus), the vital organs, which do not have any caffeine concentration sensors, lag a little bit behind in the glucose-in-the-bloodstream control, and blood glucose briefly spikes, just a little, and softly (Maybe some math about this later. Cool! ... Or, maybe not.).
       2) After all the caffeine is gone from any of the bodily organs, blood glucose levels drop down to pre-caffeinated levels. If caffeine use has become habitual and consistent, this could produce a condition of chronic low blood glucose.
       3) If one has not eaten in some time, yet is still consuming coffee, it is possible that glucose storage might run out before body systems can be mobilized to produce more, since glucose use is higher than normal in an un-monitored way. Yup, this makes for acute low blood sugar.

I have noticed
**************
all of these effects over the last several years, yet my fasting glucose and glucose tolerance seem well within normal range. A coincidence?


Anyway, I have become
*********************
a coffee whore. I will do anything for a good cup of coffee.

Example:
^^^^^^^^

Not long ago, on a trip to Vermont, my partner, Marcy, and I found a pleasant little farm-to-table diner out in the sticks. It was kind of home-y, lots of locals there, hard to get a table; all the signs of a great place.

Turns out, they hired a "chef" from a prominent New England cooking school to handle the actual heavy lifting of converting the farm-stuffs into edible fare for the patrons during the busy season. Good enough. ...

Things were a bit off. Gritty lettuce in the Caesar salad. Odd, overly mustard-y dressing, very light on anchovies. Dry, tough roast beef on the French dip. Generic, bland sweet potato fries. Probably not, generally, worth a return visit, even if we are in the area.

Except that, they source their coffee from a local roaster, and it was awesome. Awesome, awe-inspiring, truly magnificent coffee. We haven't stopped talking about it since, and may well plan our next venture to include a trip to that part of Vermont, just to go to that restaurant.

Coffee whore.

My life revolves around the stuff.
