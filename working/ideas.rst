We all learn better, faster, easier, when allowed to make our own way, our own mistakes. Some caveats: Some things we will never learn, either because we cannot, or because the circumstances that allow us to grasp the teaching of those things never come into our lives. But: Force does not make for learning. This is the key fault of the libertarian anarchist outlook. Letting people make their osn way, their own mistakes, in the belief that the consequences of their mistakes will force them to learn how to live better, or eliminate them from the population (in any effective way), belies that wonderful, basic, human instinct that, when pushed, we push back.
Learning takes place best when we are supported, protected, and nurtured. Thus, mothers and fathers. We all know this. Perhaps one of the fundamental concepts of growing up is to learn that we all must face the consequences of our actions. We can, of course, choose not to engage with them. But they will be there. There is no freedom without consequences, but no learning to deal with consequences without protection from them, when we are children. Or learners. Hm.
